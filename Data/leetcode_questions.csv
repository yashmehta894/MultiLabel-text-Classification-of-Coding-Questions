Clumsy Factorial,"Normally, the factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the number of good starting indexes.
  ","Example 1:
Input: [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can jump to i = 2 (since A[2] is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can jump to i = 3, then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can jump to i = 4, so we've reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we've reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indexes (i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.
Example 2:
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:

During our 1st jump (odd numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because A[1] is the smallest value in (A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[0].

During our 2nd jump (even numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because A[2] is the largest value in (A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is less than or equal to A[1].  A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.

During our 3rd jump (odd numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in (A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indexes (i = 1, i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

0 ≤ N ≤ 30.","Fibonacci Number The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
Given N, calculate F(N).

Equal Rational Numbers,"Given two strings S and T, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return True if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.
In general a rational number can be represented using up to three parts: an integer part, a non-repeating part, and a repeating part. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:
<IntegerPart> (e.g. 0, 12, 123)
<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart>  (e.g. 0.5, 1., 2.12, 2.0001)
<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart><(><RepeatingPart><)> (e.g. 0.1(6), 0.9(9), 0.00(1212))
The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets.  For example:
1 / 6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66)
Both 0.1(6) or 0.1666(6) or 0.166(66) are correct representations of 1 / 6.
  ","Example 1:
Input: S = ""0.(52)"", T = ""0.5(25)""
Output: true
Explanation:
Because ""0.(52)"" represents 0.52525252..., and ""0.5(25)"" represents 0.52525252525..... , the strings represent the same number.
Example 2:
Input: S = ""0.1666(6)"", T = ""0.166(66)""
Output: true
Example 3:
Input: S = ""0.9(9)"", T = ""1.""
Output: true
Explanation: 
""0.9(9)"" represents 0.999999999... repeated forever, which equals 1.  [See this link for an explanation.]
""1."" represents the number 1, which is formed correctly: (IntegerPart) = ""1"" and (NonRepeatingPart) = """".

Each part consists only of digits.
The <IntegerPart> will not begin with 2 or more zeros.  (There is no other restriction on the digits of each part.)

Prison Cells After N Days,"There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.
Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)
We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.
A board square on row r and column c has a ""snake or ladder"" if board[r][c] != -1.  The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)
Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return -1.

Loud and Rich,"In a group of N people (labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

We'll say that richer[i] = [x, y] if person x definitely has more money than person y.  Note that richer may only be a subset of valid observations.
Also, we'll say quiet[x] = q if person x has quietness q.
Now, return answer, where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person x.

Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.
Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
(which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
is person 7.

The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.
Note:
1 <= quiet.length = N <= 500
0 <= quiet[i] < N, all quiet[i] are different.
0 <= richer.length <= N * (N-1) / 2
0 <= richer[i][j] < N
richer[i][0] != richer[i][1]
richer[i]'s are all different.
The observations in richer are all logically consistent.","Loud and Rich In a group of N people (labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
Example 3:
Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10

The judging time limit has been reduced for this question.","New 21 Game Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game ""21"".
Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

Find And Replace in String,"To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).
Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing.
For example, if we have S = ""abcd"" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = ""cd"", y = ""ffff"", then because ""cd"" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with ""ffff"".
Using another example on S = ""abcd"", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = ""ab"", y = ""eee"", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = ""ec"", y = ""ffff"", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.

Masking Personal Information,"We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an email address or a phone number.
We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:

1. Email address:
We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z.
An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name. 
All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of ""name1@name2.name3"".
To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.

2. Phone number:
A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.
The local number should be formatted and masked as ""***-***-1111"", where 1 represents the exposed digits.
To mask a phone number with country code like ""+111 111 111 1111"", we write it in the form ""+***-***-***-1111"".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with ""+**-"".
Note that extraneous characters like ""("", "")"", "" "", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.

If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append ""ma"" to the end of the word.
For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
  If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add ""ma"".

Note that we cannot extend a group of size one like ""h"" to a group of size two like ""hh"" - all extensions must leave the group extended - ie., at least 3 characters long.

An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string ""let"", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", or ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on scope.

In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].
 ","My Calendar I Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.
Your class will have the method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.)
For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)

Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings,"Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.
","Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""sea"", s2 = ""eat""
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.
Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.
Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""delete"", s2 = ""leet""
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting ""dee"" from ""delete"" to turn the string into ""let"",
adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting ""e"" from ""leet"" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to ""let"", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into ""lee"" or ""eet"", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

Falling Squares,"On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.
The i-th square dropped (positions[i] = (left, side_length)) is a square with the left-most point being positions[i][0] and sidelength positions[i][1].
The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and from a higher height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each square to stick before dropping the next.
The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed to any positive length surface they touch (either the number line or another square). Squares dropped adjacent to each other will not stick together prematurely.

-------
The maximum height of any square is 2.
After the second drop of positions[1] = [2, 3]:
__aaa

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.
The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

Explanation:
Function 0 starts at time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1. 
Now function 0 calls function 1, function 1 starts at time 2, executes 4 units of time and end at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at time 6, and also end at the time 6, thus executes 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 totally execute 2 + 1 = 3 units of time, and function 1 totally execute 4 units of time.
Note:
Input logs will be sorted by timestamp, NOT log id.
Your output should be sorted by function id, which means the 0th element of your output corresponds to the exclusive time of function 0.

The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

The Skyline Problem,"A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).
The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
The output is a list of ""key points"" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.
For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
  Example 3:
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
  Notes:
If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

s = ""aa""
p = ""a*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the precedeng element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes ""aa"".
Example 3:

s = ""ab""
p = "".*""
Output: true
Explanation: "".*"" means ""zero or more (*) of any character (.)"".
Example 4:

String to Integer (atoi),"Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

Pour Water,"We are given an elevation map, heights[i] representing the height of the terrain at that index. The width at each index is 1. After V units of water fall at index K, how much water is at each index?
Water first drops at index K and rests on top of the highest terrain or water at that index. Then, it flows according to the following rules:
If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left.
Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then move right.
Otherwise, rise at it's current position.
Here, ""eventually fall"" means that the droplet will eventually be at a lower level if it moves in that direction. Also, ""level"" means the height of the terrain plus any water in that column.
We can assume there's infinitely high terrain on the two sides out of bounds of the array. Also, there could not be partial water being spread out evenly on more than 1 grid block - each unit of water has to be in exactly one block.
","Example 1:
Input: heights = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2], V = 4, K = 3

Explanation:
#       #
#       #
##  # ###
#########
 0123456    <- index

The first drop of water lands at index K = 3:

#       #
#   w   #
##  # ###
#########
 0123456    

When moving left or right, the water can only move to the same level or a lower level.
(By level, we mean the total height of the terrain plus any water in that column.)
Since moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left.
(A droplet ""made to fall"" means go to a lower height than it was at previously.)

#       #
#       #
## w# ###
#########
 0123456    

Since moving left will not make it fall, it stays in place.  The next droplet falls:

#       #
#   w   #
## w# ###
#########
 0123456  

Since the new droplet moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left.
Notice that the droplet still preferred to move left,
even though it could move right (and moving right makes it fall quicker.)

#       #
#  w    #
## w# ###
#########
 0123456  

#       #
#       #
##ww# ###
#########
 0123456  

After those steps, the third droplet falls.
Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right.
Since moving right would eventually make it fall, it moves right.

#       #
#   w   #
##ww# ###
#########
 0123456  

#       #
#       #
##ww#w###
#########
 0123456  

Finally, the fourth droplet falls.
Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right.
Since moving right would not eventually make it fall, it stays in place:

#       #
#   w   #
##ww#w###

Example 2:
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4], V = 2, K = 2
Output: [2,3,3,4]
Explanation:
The last droplet settles at index 1, since moving further left would not cause it to eventually fall to a lower height.
Example 3:
Input: heights = [3,1,3], V = 5, K = 1
Output: [4,4,4]
Note:
heights will have length in [1, 100] and contain integers in [0, 99].

IP to CIDR,"Given a start IP address ip and a number of ips we need to cover n, return a representation of the range as a list (of smallest possible length) of CIDR blocks.
A CIDR block is a string consisting of an IP, followed by a slash, and then the prefix length. For example: ""123.45.67.89/20"". That prefix length ""20"" represents the number of common prefix bits in the specified range.
","Example 1:
Input: ip = ""255.0.0.7"", n = 10
Output: [""255.0.0.7/32"",""255.0.0.8/29"",""255.0.0.16/32""]
Explanation:
The initial ip address, when converted to binary, looks like this (spaces added for clarity):
255.0.0.7 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000111
The address ""255.0.0.7/32"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just this one address.

The address ""255.0.0.8/29"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 29 bits to the given address:
255.0.0.8 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
Addresses with common prefix of 29 bits are:
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001001

11111111 00000000 00000000 00001111

The address ""255.0.0.16/32"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just 11111111 00000000 00000000 00010000.

In total, the answer specifies the range of 10 ips starting with the address 255.0.0.7 .

There were other representations, such as:
[""255.0.0.7/32"",""255.0.0.8/30"", ""255.0.0.12/30"", ""255.0.0.16/32""],
but our answer was the shortest possible.

Also note that a representation beginning with say, ""255.0.0.7/30"" would be incorrect,
because it includes addresses like 255.0.0.4 = 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000100

 ",,"Sentence Similarity Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.
For example, ""great acting skills"" and ""fine drama talent"" are similar, if the similar word pairs are pairs = [[""great"", ""fine""], [""acting"",""drama""], [""skills"",""talent""]].
Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if ""great"" and ""fine"" are similar, and ""fine"" and ""good"" are similar, ""great"" and ""good"" are not necessarily similar.
However, similarity is symmetric. For example, ""great"" and ""fine"" being similar is the same as ""fine"" and ""great"" being similar.
Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = [""great""], words2 = [""great""], pairs = [] are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.
Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like words1 = [""great""] can never be similar to words2 = [""doubleplus"",""good""].

The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.

int[] Retrieve(String start, String end, String granularity): Return the id of logs whose timestamps are within the range from start to end. Start and end all have the same format as timestamp. However, granularity means the time level for consideration. For example, start = ""2017:01:01:23:59:59"", end = ""2017:01:02:23:59:59"", granularity = ""Day"", it means that we need to find the logs within the range from Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd 2017.

Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

Explanation
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,

Kill Process,"Given n processes, each process has a unique PID (process id) and its PPID (parent process id).
Each process only has one parent process, but may have one or more children processes. This is just like a tree structure. Only one process has PPID that is 0, which means this process has no parent process. All the PIDs will be distinct positive integers.
We use two list of integers to represent a list of processes, where the first list contains PID for each process and the second list contains the corresponding PPID.
Now given the two lists, and a PID representing a process you want to kill, return a list of PIDs of processes that will be killed in the end. You should assume that when a process is killed, all its children processes will be killed. No order is required for the final answer.

Maximum Vacation Days,"LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.
Rules and restrictions:
You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.
The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.
You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.
For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.
You're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.
","Example 1:
Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. 
One of the best strategies is:
1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. 
(Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) 
2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.
3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.
Example 2:
Input:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. 
For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. 
So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.
Example 3:
Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]
Output: 21
Explanation:
Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21
One of the best strategies is:
1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. 
2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.
3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.
Note:
N and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].
In the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].
In the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].
You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.
If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.
We don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days.","Maximum Vacation Days LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems.

Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times,"Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
  Method read4:
The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.
Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
File file(""abcdefghijk""); // File is ""abcdefghijk"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""abcd"", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""efgh"", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = ""ijk"", fp points to end of file
  Method read:
By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Definition of read:
    Parameters: char[] buf, int n
    Returns: int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]

// Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain ""a"". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain ""bc"". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Example 2:
File file(""abc"");

sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain ""abc"". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
  Note:
Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly, the file is only accesible for read4 but not for read.

You may assume the destination buffer array, buf, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing n characters.
It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer buf is called by read.","Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
  Method read4:
The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.
Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
File file(""abcdefghijk""); // File is ""abcdefghijk"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""abcd"", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""efgh"", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = ""ijk"", fp points to end of file
  Method read:
By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Definition of read:
    Parameters: char[] buf, int n

","Implement two stacks in an array Your task is to implement  2 stacks in one array efficiently .
Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 4 Types
(i)    1 1 x    (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the stack 1)
(ii)   1 2      (a query of this type means to pop element from stack1  and print the poped element)
(iii)  2 1 x  (a query of this type means pushing 'x' into the stack 2)
(iv)  2 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from stack2 and print the poped element)
The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.
Output Format:
The output for each test case will be space separated integers having -1 if the stack is empty else the element poped out from the stack. 
You are required to complete the 4  methods push1, push2 which takes one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack one and two  and pop1, pop2 which returns a integer poped out from stack one and two .

The friendliness of 1 with other elemnts are
F(1,4) = |1-4| = 3
F(1,5) = |1-5| = 4
Min(F(1,4),F(1,5)) = 3 => This means 1 is closet friend to 4
The friendliness of 5 with other elemnts are
F(5,1) = |5-1| = 4
F(5,4) = |5-4| = 1
Min(F(5,1),F(5,4)) = 1 => This means 5 is closet friend to 4

Explanation : 
In first test case, the output solution looks as follows. First apply an incremental operation to each element. Then apply the doubling operation four times. Total number of operations is 3+4 = 7
In second test case, to get the target array from {0, 0}, we first increment both elements by 1 (2 operations), then double the array (1 operation). Finally increment second element (1 more operation)  Total number of operations is 2+1+1 = 4
In third test case , one of the optimal solution is to apply the incremental operation 2 times to first and once on second element.Total number of operations is 1+1+1 = 3

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
To reach the first station from the starting point, we need to buy 1 chocolate,
To reach station 2 form station 1, we get A[1] – A[2] = -1 chocolates i.e. we lose 1 chocolate. Hence, we need to buy 1 chocolate.
Similarly, we need to buy 1 chocolate to reach station 3 from station 2.
   Hence, total cost incurred = (1+1+1)*10 = 30
Test Case 2:
To reach to the first station from starting point he need to buy 10 chocolates. 
Chocolates Bought = 10 ,  Chocolates balance = 0
On reaching second station he will get (10-6)= 4 chocolates.
Chocolates Bought= 10 , Chocolates balance = 4.
To reach to 3 station , he has to buy (6- 11) = 5 chocolates. But he has 4 chocolates as balance So the chocolates he need to buy is (5 -4 ) =1;
Chocolates Bought= 11 , Chocolates balance = 0.
On reaching station 4 , he will get (11 - 4)= 7 chocolates.
Chocolates Bought= 11 , Chocolates balance = 7.
To reach to 5 station , he has to buy (4- 7) = 3 chocolates. But he has 7 chocolates as balance .
Chocolates Bought= 11 , Chocolates balance = 4.
To reach to 6 station , he will get (7- 1) = 6 chocolates. 
Chocolates Bought= 11 , Chocolates balance = 10.
Therefore , total chocolates he has to buy  is 11.
Hence, Amount=11*5=55.

When you cross a hurdle of height h, your current energy gets reduced by h. The remaining energy can rolled over for subsequent hurdles.
Also, after your character crosses a hurdle, it gets an energy boost that is equal to the position of that hurdle(1,2,3....).
So, given N, N energy states, and N hurdle heights; you need to find whether you can win the game or not. You can only win, if your character can successfully cross all the hurdles.

Case 1 : 
Heights : 5 3 2 6 8
Ishaan can climb a wall with height atmost 5. So he climbs the first 3 walls easily.
Now he has to use his power to reduce the height of the 4th wall.
After using his power, heights : 5 3 2 1 8
Now to climb the last wall, he again uses his power.
Final heights : 5 3 2 1 3
Case 2 : 
Heights : 2 4 6 8 1 6
Ishaan can climb a wall with height atmost 4. So he climbs the first 2 walls easily.
Now he has to use his power to reduce the height of the 3rd wall.

Explanation:
Assume 0-based indexing
Testcase 1:
Firstly, 2nd ticket seller can sell his one ticket at price = 6. Then, he will have 5 tickets with price = 5. He can again sell one ticket with price = 5. Now, he will have 4 tickets with price = 4. At last, any of the 0th, 2nd or 4th ticket seller can sell one ticket as all of them are priced at 4. Hence, the total amount after selling 3 tickets = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.
Testcase 2:
Firstly, 0th or 2nd ticket seller can sell his one ticket at price = 5. Let us assume that 2nd ticket seller sells his ticket. Now, he would be left with 4 tickets each with price = 4. Now, 0th ticket seller will sell his one ticket at price = 5 and now he will have 4 tickets each with price = 4. Hence, the total amount after selling 2 tickets = 5 + 5 = 10.

Explanation:
The barriers cover lanes from 1 to 3, 5 to 8, 8 to 13, 14 to 15 and 9 to 12. Hence, barriers are present on the lanes: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.
Hence, the lanes which doesn't come under any barriers are {4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}.
So, there are 6 lanes on which athletes can run – {4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}

Explanation:
In 1st test case
Matrix will be
a d g k
b d h l
c e i  l
c f  j m
In 1st column 'c', in 2nd column 'd' and in 4th column 'l' has occurred more than once. So after deleting them and sorting the remaining characters the matrix become
   a - g  k
   b - h  -
   - e i   -
   - f  j  m
So after operation 2 we get 'ab' from 1st column, 'ef' from 2nd column, 'gjhi' from 3rd column and 'km' from 4th column. Appending all of them we get the output as  ""abefgjhikm"".
In 3rd test case

The employee with rank 2 and rank 3 have Mr. Alfred as their senior.
2 + 1 = 3 is a prime and 3 + 1 = 4 is not a prime.
The employee with rank 4 has Employee 2 as its immediate senior. Hence, number of seniors of Employee 4 = 2 (i.e. employee 2 and Mr. Alfred)
4 + 2 = 6 is not a prime.
Hence, the result is 1.
For 2nd case:
Employee 3 is Mr. Alfred. 
Employee 2 is Mr. Alfred’s immediate subordinate. His level is 1.
2 + 1 = 3 is a prime.
Employee 1 is Employee 2’s immediate subordinate. His level is 2.

Brackets in Matrix Chain Multiplication,"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications. There are many options to multiply a chain of matrices because matrix multiplication is associative i.e. no matter how one parenthesize the product, the result will be the same.

In the first test case, 1 that occurs in the 1st row and 1st column, has 3 surrounding elements 0,1 and 1. The occurrence of zero is odd. 1 that occurs in 2nd row and 1st column has 5 surrounding elements 1,0,1,1 and 0. The occurrence of zero is even. 1 that occurs in 2nd row and 2nd column has 8 surrounding elements. The occurrence of 0 is odd. Similarly, for the 1 that occurs in 3rd row and 2nd column, the occurrence of zero in it's 5 surrounding elements is odd. Hence, the output is 1.
In the second test case, there is only 1 element in the matrix. Hence, it has no surroundings, so it's count for even 0's is 0 for the whole matrix. 0 is even but we want occurrence of a zero in the surrounding at least once. Hence, output is 0.

Hopscotch,"Aakriti, Avantika and Mehak are playing Hopscotch (Stapu). The arena is in the form of 2d Array with little modification as shown below:
So, in this game the person who is playing need to collect stones present on the tiles that are adjacent to the tile on which the player stands. Mehak is playing and if Avantika asks her to collect stones then she will move only one step in any direction to collect all the stones from the tiles that are touching the edge with the tile on which she is standing. But if Aakriti ask her, she will move two steps in any direction and then collect stones. Help Mehak to count the total number of stones she collected.

e.g.
Message: eNEMYwILLaTTACK

The way to do it is that the number of rows and the number of columns in the figure (formed from the alphabets of the Message) lie between floor (sqrt(len(message))) and ceil (sqrt(len(message))). It also states that the number of rows is less than or equal to the number of columns, and that the area of rectangle thus formed is minimum. Based on the this criteria, we have to choose a set of values for rows and columns.

For the string haveaniceday, we have floor(sqrt(len(message))) = 3 and ceil(sqrt(len(message))) = 4.

Explanation:
In the first testcase ( only one cycle ), the initial numbers are ( X = 1, Y = 2). There is only one turn. In this turn X is multiplied by 2. Hence, we get (X = 2, Y = 2). Therefore W = 2, and Z = 2 . max ( W , Z ) / min ( W ,  Z ) =  2 / 2  = 1. Hence the first output is 1.
In the second testcase, the initial numbers are (X = 3, Y = 2) . There three turns. In the first cycle X is multiplied by 2 . So, we get ( X = 6, Y = 2 ) . In the second cycle Y ( Y = 2)  multiplies his number by 2. Hence, we get  ( X = 6,  Y = 4 ) . In the third cycle  X ( X = 6) is multiplied by 2. So, we get (X = 12, Y = 4) . As N = 3 , and we are completed with 3 cyles ,  therefore W = 12, and Z = 4 .
max ( W ,  Z ) / min ( W , Z ) = 12 / 4 = 3. Hence the second output is 3.

Roll No 2 gets 78. 2 is a fibonacci number and hence 78 is multiplied by 2 and becomes 156 which being greater than 100 is reduced to 56.
Roll No 3 gets 80. 3 is a fibonacci number and hence 80 is multiplied by 3 and it becomes 240 which being greater than 100 is reduced to 40.
Roll No 4 gets 91. 4 is not a fibonacci number and hence 91 is kept as it is.
Roll No 5 gets 99. 5 is a fibonacci number and hence 99 is multiplied by 5 and becomes 495 which being greater than 100 is reduced to 95. The class total becomes 316 and an average of 63.2 floor of which is 63 .

Now H becomes floor(5/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5+5+2. The ball goes down. d=10+10+5+5+2+2. H becomes floor(2/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5+5+2+2+1. It goes down to ground. d=10+10+5+5+2+2+1+1. H becomes floor(1/2). H is zero so no rebound. total d=36.
","Jumpy Ball You have a jumpy ball. You throw it up from the ground upto a height of H. The ball is jumpy, so when it comes back to the ground, it rebounds and goes up again to a distance of floor(H/2). This keeps on repeating till it can't rebound anymore. You need to find the total distance travelled by the ball.

Find the final status of all the doors, when all the persons have changed the status of the doors of which they are authorized. i.e. if status open then change the status to closed and vice versa. A person with id ‘i’ is authorized to change the status of door numbered ‘j’ if ‘j’ is a multiple of ‘i’.

Note: A person has to change the current status of all the doors for which he is authorized exactly once.

Maximum Collatz sequence length,"Starting with any positive integer N, we define the Collatz sequence corresponding to N as the numbers formed by the following operations:
N → N/2 ( if N is even)
N → 3N + 1 (if N is odd)
i.e. If N is even, divide it by 2 to get N / 2. If N is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3N + 1.
It is conjectured but not yet proven that no matter which positive integer we start with; we always end up with 1.
For example, 10 → 5  → 16  → 8  → 4  → 2  → 1
Note: The sequence should end at the 1st occurence of integer 1.

Explanation:
For the 1st test case where N = 3
For N= 3 we need to check sequence length when sequence starts with 1,2, and 3.
when sequence starts with 1, it's : 1 length = 1
when sequence starts with 2, it's : 2->1, length = 2
when sequence starts with 3, it's : 3->10->5->16->8->4->2->1, length = 8, which is max of all.

The resulting array would be- 7 7 7 7
Number of moves = 1 + 7 + 5 = 13.
","Equalize an array in minimum operations You are given with an array of N integers A[0], A[1], … , A[N-1] and an integer k. Your task is to make all the elements of the given array equal in a minimum number of ‘moves’.  All the elements of the array are non-negative.
In each ‘move’ you may add or subtract k from any element of the array.
Print -1 if it is not possible to make all the elements equal in any number of moves.

Explanation:
Testcase1:
Input : n = 12
Output : 13
We break n = 12 in three parts {12/2, 12/3, 12/4} = {6, 4, 3},  now current sum is = (6 + 4 + 3) = 13
Again, we break 6 = {6/2, 6/3, 6/4} = {3, 2, 1} = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and further breaking 3, 2 and 1 we get maximum
summation as 1, so breaking 6 in three parts produces maximum sum 6 only similarly breaking 4 in three parts we can get maximum sum 4 and same for 3 also. Thus maximum sum by breaking number in parts  is=13
Testcase2:
Input : n = 24
Output : 27
We break n = 24 in three parts {24/2, 24/3, 24/4} = {12, 8, 6},  now current sum is = (12 + 8 + 6) = 16
As seen in example, recursively breaking 12 would produce value 13. So our maximum sum is 13 + 8 + 6 = 27.
Note that recursively breaking 8 and 6 doesn't produce more values, that is why they are not broken further.

Explanation:
Test case 1:
All temples must receive at-least one offering. Now, the second temple is at a higher altitude compared to the first one. Thus it receives one extra offering. The second temple and third temple are at the same height, so we do not need to modify the offerings. Offerings given are therefore: 1, 2, 1 giving a total of 4.
Test case 2:
We can distribute the offerings in the following way, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1. The second temple has to receive more offerings than the first due to its height being higher. The fourth must receive more than the fifth, which in turn must receive more than the sixth. Thus the total becomes 10.

Also, Rahul will purchase exactly one type of vegetable item (only 1 kg) from one shop. Rahul wishes to spend minimum money buying vegetables using this strategy. Help Rahul determine the minimum money he will spend.
Input:
First line indicates number of test cases T. Each test case in its first line contains N denoting the number of vegetable sellers in Vegetable Market. Then each of next N lines contains three space separated integers denoting cost of brinjal, carrot and tomato per kg with that particular vegetable seller.
Output:
For each test case, output the minimum cost of shopping taking the mentioned conditions into account in a separate line.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100000
Cost of each vegetable(brinjal/carrot/tomato) per kg does not exceed 10^4

1 50 50
Output:
52
Explanation:
There are two ways, each one gives 52 as minimum cost. One way is buy brinjals from first shop, carrots from second shop and brinjals from third shop or he can buy brinjals from first shop, tomatoes from second shop and brinjals from third shop.
Both ways , cost comes up to 1 + 50 + 1 = 52

He can start from 'a' at index 0 or 1 or 2 and then move to 'b' at index 3 or 4, then jump to 'c' at index 5 and then go to  'd' at greater index than 6 which is 8. Thus the answer is 8.

If they found that number is not a power of 2, then they reduce the number by the largest power of 2 less than the number and if they found that the number is a power of 2, they simply reduces the number by the half. Then they perform the same operations with the new number generated until the number n becomes 1 and further no one can play the game. The last person to make a valid move will win the game.

Punish the Students,"A Professor conducts a Computer Science paper for all students. He had strictly ordered all students to sit according to their roll numbers. However when he started checking the papers, he found out that all the papers were randomly ordered. The students had sat randomly during the exam instead of sitting according to their roll numbers. Professor was very angry and he wanted to teach the students a lesson. He decides to sort the papers by Bubble Sort, count the number of swaps required for each and every student and deduct as many marks of a student as were the number of swaps required for that student. However he also has to maintain a class average of atleast M else he may lose his job. The Professor wants to know whether he should punish the students or save his job.
