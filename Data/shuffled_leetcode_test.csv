Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s then it is an invalid string.
Example :
Given encoded message ""123"",  it could be decoded as ""ABC"" (1 2 3) or ""LC"" (12 3) or ""AW""(1 23).

You may from index i jump forward to index j (with i < j) in the following way:
During odd numbered jumps (ie. jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that A[i] <= A[j] and A[j] is the smallest possible value.  If there are multiple such indexes j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
During even numbered jumps (ie. jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that A[i] >= A[j] and A[j] is the largest possible value.  If there are multiple such indexes j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
(It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.)
A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index A.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once.)
Return the number of good starting indexes.

Ishaan also has a superpower. He can reduce the height of a wall H by K by using his superpower. Since he can't use this power many times, calculate the minimum number of times he has to use this power to go over all the walls.
Input : 
First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the heights of the walls.

Explanation : 
Case 1 : 
Heights : 5 3 2 6 8
Ishaan can climb a wall with height atmost 5. So he climbs the first 3 walls easily.
Now he has to use his power to reduce the height of the 4th wall.
After using his power, heights : 5 3 2 1 8
Now to climb the last wall, he again uses his power.
Final heights : 5 3 2 1 3
Case 2 : 
Heights : 2 4 6 8 1 6
Ishaan can climb a wall with height atmost 4. So he climbs the first 2 walls easily.
Now he has to use his power to reduce the height of the 3rd wall.
After using his power, heights : 2 4 2 8 1 6
Now to climb the next wall, he again uses his power.
Heights : 2 4 2 4 1 6
He climbs the 5th wall easily.
To climb the last wall, h uses his power again.
Final Heights : 2 4 2 4 1 2
Case 3 : 
Since all the heights are already below K(=3), Ishaan can climb all the walls without using his powers.

Design Search Autocomplete System,"Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.
Your job is to implement the following functions:
The constructor function:
AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. The input is historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.
Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:
List<String> input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

Sentence Similarity,"Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.
For example, ""great acting skills"" and ""fine drama talent"" are similar, if the similar word pairs are pairs = [[""great"", ""fine""], [""acting"",""drama""], [""skills"",""talent""]].
Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if ""great"" and ""fine"" are similar, and ""fine"" and ""good"" are similar, ""great"" and ""good"" are not necessarily similar.
However, similarity is symmetric. For example, ""great"" and ""fine"" being similar is the same as ""fine"" and ""great"" being similar.
Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = [""great""], words2 = [""great""], pairs = [] are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.
Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like words1 = [""great""] can never be similar to words2 = [""doubleplus"",""good""].
Note:
The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].
