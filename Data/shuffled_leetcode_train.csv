Merge Sort on Doubly Linked List,"Given Pointer/Reference to the head of a doubly linked list, task is to Sort the given doubly linked list using Merge Sort.

    struct node *second = splitList(head);
    head = mergeSort(head);
    second = mergeSort(second);
    return merge(head, second);
}
The spliList() function takes a single input, the pointer reference to the head of the doubly linked list. The function return pointers reference to the head of the second list. The function splits the linked list in to two halves just like in standard merge sort. As the name suggests function merge will merge two doubly linked lists, as in standard merge sort.

Brackets in Matrix Chain Multiplication,"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications. There are many options to multiply a chain of matrices because matrix multiplication is associative i.e. no matter how one parenthesize the product, the result will be the same.
Example:
 if you had four matrices A, B, C, and D, you would have:
    (ABC)D = (AB)(CD) = A(BCD) = ....
However, the order in which one parenthesize the product affects the number of simple arithmetic operations needed to compute the product, or the efficiency.
For example:
A: 10 × 30 matrix
B : 30 × 5 matrix
C : 5 × 60 matrix
Then,
     (AB)C = (10×30×5) + (10×5×60)
           = 1500 + 3000 
           = 4500 operations
      A(BC) = (30×5×60) + (10×30×60) 
            = 9000 + 18000 
            = 27000 operations.

Candy Crush,"This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.
Given a 2D integer array board representing the grid of candy, different positive integers board[i][j] represent different types of candies. A value of board[i][j] = 0 represents that the cell at position (i, j) is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:
If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, ""crush"" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.
After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)
After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.
If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is stable), then return the current board.
You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.

Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List,"Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the previous and next pointers in a doubly-linked list.

    We want to transform this BST into a circular doubly linked list. Each node in a doubly linked list has a predecessor and successor. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.
The figure below shows the circular doubly linked list for the BST above. The ""head"" symbol means the node it points to is the smallest element of the linked list.
    Specifically, we want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. We should return the pointer to the first element of the linked list.
The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.

Mila and strings,"Mila has a string(consisting of only lowercase characters) which she wants to gift her best friend Gila. She wants to put the string in a gift box to gift it to Gila. She calculated the width of the gift box to be k units smaller than the length of the string. The string being larger than the box, Mila would now require to remove characters from the string.
Gila once told Mila about her liking for lexicographically smallest strings. Now, Mila wants the string to be lexicographically smallest to make her best friend happy. While calculating the width of the box, Mila made a small mistake. The correction in the value of k is - If the length of the string is a power of 2, reduce k by half, else multiply k by 2.
Help Mila in finding the resulting string.

String to Integer (atoi),"Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.
Output Format:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the stack is empty else the element poped out from the stack . 
You are required to complete the two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack  and pop which returns a integer poped out from the stack.

Equal Rational Numbers,"Given two strings S and T, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return True if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.
In general a rational number can be represented using up to three parts: an integer part, a non-repeating part, and a repeating part. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:
<IntegerPart> (e.g. 0, 12, 123)
<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart>  (e.g. 0.5, 1., 2.12, 2.0001)
<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart><(><RepeatingPart><)> (e.g. 0.1(6), 0.9(9), 0.00(1212))
The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets.  For example:
1 / 6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66)
Both 0.1(6) or 0.1666(6) or 0.166(66) are correct representations of 1 / 6.

Sentence Similarity II,"Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.

Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if ""great"" and ""good"" are similar, and ""fine"" and ""good"" are similar, then ""great"" and ""fine"" are similar.
Similarity is also symmetric. For example, ""great"" and ""fine"" being similar is the same as ""fine"" and ""great"" being similar.
Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = [""great""], words2 = [""great""], pairs = [] are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.
Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like words1 = [""great""] can never be similar to words2 = [""doubleplus"",""good""].
Note:
The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.

The Wedding Date,"Raj and Simran are very close friends. They want to marry but Simran's parents are not ready. Simran's father is very superstitious and believes that wedding can only happen if they will ready to marry at a date given by him(dd mm yyyy format). Since Raj is a very busy person, he can't agree with this situation as he has to take a leave from his work. So Simran came through an idea that they will marry on the date that will consist of all the digits of the date given by his father with same occurrences i.e. only the positions of the digits alter. Since Simran has other jobs to do, you have to help her to find the nearest date(that comes after the date his father given to him) that can be formed by the digits that her father gave to her.

For the i-th query queries[i] = (x, y), the answer to the query is 1 if the cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.
After each query (x, y) [in the order given by queries], we turn off any lamps that are at cell (x, y) or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell (x, y).)
Return an array of answers.  Each value answer[i] should be equal to the answer of the i-th query queries[i].

We instead make a clumsy factorial: using the integers in decreasing order, we swap out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations: multiply (*), divide (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this order.
For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.  However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.
Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 equals 11.  This guarantees the result is an integer.
Implement the clumsy function as defined above: given an integer N, it returns the clumsy factorial of N.

Rules and restrictions:
You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.
The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.
You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.
For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.
You're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.

An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.
For example, you may encode the following 3-ary tree to a binary tree in this way:

Explanation : 
Case 1 : 
Initially : EOOE
We add 1 to the 2nd element. Its neighbouring 3rd element is also made even.
So we add 1 to only the 2nd element.
Case 2 : 
Initially : OEEOE
We first add 1 to the 1st element. None of its neighbouring element is odd, so nothing can be done here.
Then we add 1 to the 4th element. None of its neighbouring element is odd, so nothing can be done here.
Case 3 : 
Initially : OOOO
We first add 1 to the 1st element. Its neighbouring 2nd element which is odd, is converted to even. Now the neighbouring 3rd element of 2nd element is odd, so it is also converted to even. Similarly the 4th element is also made even.
We added 1 only to the 1st element, so answer is 1.

Basic Calculator IV,"Given an expression such as expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"" and an evaluation map such as {""e"": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = [""e""] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as [""-1*a"",""14""]
An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".
Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].
The format of the output is as follows:
For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".
Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""] 
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].

The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.

Validate IP Address,"Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.
IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("".""), e.g.,172.16.254.1;
Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.
IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons ("":""). For example, the address 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).
However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334 is an invalid IPv6 address.
Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is invalid.
Note: You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.

His parents gave him a task, that was to make a string of size 'n'. Each character of the string is either ‘R’, ‘B’ or ‘G’. In the final string there needs to be at least 'r' number of ‘R’, at least 'b' number of ‘B’ and at least 'g' number of ‘G’ (such that r + g + b <= n).

Examples:
Input : n = 4, r = 1, 
        b = 1, g = 1.
Output: 36 
No. of 'R' >= 1, 
No. of ‘G’ >= 1, 
No. of ‘B’ >= 1 and 
(No. of ‘R’) + (No. of ‘B’) + (No. of ‘G’) = n

1. RBGR and its 12 permutation
2. RBGB and its 12 permutation
3. RBGG and its 12 permutation

Now what you have to do - you have to send their secrets to your Army headquaters but you can't send the message directly you have to encrypt it, so that no other person can read it.

e.g.
Message: eNEMYwILLaTTACK
Enrypted Form: eYLA NwaC EITK MLT

The way to do it is that the number of rows and the number of columns in the figure (formed from the alphabets of the Message) lie between floor (sqrt(len(message))) and ceil (sqrt(len(message))). It also states that the number of rows is less than or equal to the number of columns, and that the area of rectangle thus formed is minimum. Based on the this criteria, we have to choose a set of values for rows and columns.

For the string haveaniceday, we have floor(sqrt(len(message))) = 3 and ceil(sqrt(len(message))) = 4.

3 * 3 = 9 < len(message) = 15
3 * 4 = 12 = len(message)
4 * 3 = 12 = len(message)
4 * 4 = 16 > len(message)

Out of the 4 possible squares, we can see that #rows = 3 and #columns = 4 is the best fit.
On building the figure, we get

The Maze III,"There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up (u), down (d), left (l) or right (r), but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.
Given the ball position, the hole position and the maze, find out how the ball could drop into the hole by moving the shortest distance. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the hole (included). Output the moving directions by using 'u', 'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different shortest ways, you should output the lexicographically smallest way. If the ball cannot reach the hole, output ""impossible"".
The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The ball and the hole coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

For each node, it will be subdivided into four children nodes until the values in the region it represents are all the same. Each node has another two boolean attributes : isLeaf and val. isLeaf is true if and only if the node is a leaf node. The val attribute for a leaf node contains the value of the region it represents.

The Skyline Problem,"A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).
The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
The output is a list of ""key points"" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.
For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].
Notes:
The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].

There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times,"Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
  Method read4:
The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.
Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
File file(""abcdefghijk""); // File is ""abcdefghijk"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""abcd"", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""efgh"", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = ""ijk"", fp points to end of file
  Method read:
By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Definition of read:
    Parameters: char[] buf, int n

Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.
If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case. (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

Input : s = ""bca""
        roll[] = {1, 2, 3}         
Output : eeb

Explanation :
arr[0] = 1 means roll first character of string -> cca
arr[1] = 2 means roll first two characters of string -> dda
arr[2] = 3 means roll first three characters of string -> eeb
So final ans is ""eeb""

Azad is not good at programming so he is asking you to help him to solve a problem given below.
By using lower case character from a to z you have to form a string of length N (1 ≤ N≤ 100) using following instructions.
When N is even:
Use N/2 (when N ≤ 26) number of sequence characters or character from starting and ending part of a to z .
For example     N= 2  az
                         N=4   abyz 
When N is greater than 26 repeat the instructions again. For example N= 28 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaz
When N is odd:
Use (N-1)/2 (when N ≤ 26) number of sequence characters or character from starting and ending part of a to z and to select the middle character use case 1 and case 2.
Case 1- when sum of digits or digit of N is equal to even Give preference to those characters whose ASCII value is smaller to select the middle character of string.
for example N=11 ( 1+1= 2 is even)    
abcdefvwxyz is correct
abcdeuvwxyz is incorrect
Case 2- when sum of digits or digit of N is equal to odd Give preference to those characters whose ASCII value is greater to select the middle character of string.
for example N=21 ( 2+1= 3 is odd)  
abcdefghijpqrstuvwxyz is correct
abcdefghijkqrstuvwxyz is incorrect
When N is greater than 26 repeat the instructions again . For example N= 29   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzayz

Matrix Chain Multiplication,"Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications. There are many options to multiply a chain of matrices because matrix multiplication is associative i.e. no matter how one parenthesize the product, the result will be the same.
Example:
 if you had four matrices A, B, C, and D, you would have:
    (ABC)D = (AB)(CD) = A(BCD) = ....
However, the order in which one parenthesize the product affects the number of simple arithmetic operations needed to compute the product, or the efficiency.
For example:
A: 10 × 30 matrix
B : 30 × 5 matrix
C : 5 × 60 matrix
Then,
     (AB)C = (10×30×5) + (10×5×60) 
           = 1500 + 3000 
           = 4500 operations
     A(BC) = (30×5×60) + (10×30×60) 
           = 9000 + 18000 
           = 27000 operations.

Explanation
As according to the offer if you but one candy you can take atmost two more for free.
So in the first case you buy the candy which costs 1 and take candies worth 3 and 4 for free, also you buy candy worth 2 as well.
So min cost = 1+2 =3.
In the second case I buy the candy which costs 4 and take candies worth 1 and 2 for free, also I  buy candy worth 3 as well.
So max cost = 3+4 =7.

Riya's Test,"Riya loves to play with strings. She discoverd her own kind of strings which passed the Riya's Test. When split from the middle, the string gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character. If the number of characters in the string are odd,  ignore the middle character and check for the 2 halves to pass the Riya's Test. For example, papa passes the Riya's Test, since the two halves pa and pa have the same characters with the same frequency.
eefefe and bananb pass Riya's Test. Note that motor, abcd, color, flipflop fails Riya's Test. Given a string, find out whether the string passes Riya's Test or not.

Read N Characters Given Read4,"Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method to read n characters.
  Method read4:
The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.
Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
File file(""abcdefghijk""); // File is ""abcdefghijk"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""abcd"", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = ""efgh"", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = ""ijk"", fp points to end of file
  Method read:
By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Definition of read:
    Parameters: char[] buf, int n
    Returns: int

An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name. 
All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of ""name1@name2.name3"".
To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.

2. Phone number:
A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.
The local number should be formatted and masked as ""***-***-1111"", where 1 represents the exposed digits.
To mask a phone number with country code like ""+111 111 111 1111"", we write it in the form ""+***-***-***-1111"".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with ""+**-"".
Note that extraneous characters like ""("", "")"", "" "", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.

RLE Iterator,"Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator supports one function: next(int n), which exhausts the next n elements (n >= 1) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, next returns -1 instead.
For example, we start with A = [3,8,0,9,2,5], which is a run-length encoding of the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].  This is because the sequence can be read as ""three eights, zero nines, two fives"".

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Parse Lisp Expression,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.
The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.
An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string ""let"", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", or ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on scope.

Explanation
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

  For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
  |accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|
  Note:
The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.
It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.
If there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.
  Explanation: There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So the rate is 0.80.

Can you write a query to return the accept rate but for every month?

| 2017-02   | 2             | same        |
  Explanation
  In March, the company's average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...
  The average salary for department '1' is 9000, which is the salary of employee_id '1' since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is 'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.
  The average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of employee_id '2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower' since 8000 < 8333.33.
  With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same' since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.

The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.
  Explanation:
The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.

On each turn, you may place the stamp over the sequence, and replace every letter in the sequence with the corresponding letter from the stamp.  You can make up to 10 * target.length turns.
For example, if the initial sequence is ""?????"", and your stamp is ""abc"",  then you may make ""abc??"", ""?abc?"", ""??abc"" in the first turn.  (Note that the stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of the sequence in order to stamp.)
If the sequence is possible to stamp, then return an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn.  If the sequence is not possible to stamp, return an empty array.
For example, if the sequence is ""ababc"", and the stamp is ""abc"", then we could return the answer [0, 2], corresponding to the moves ""?????"" -> ""abc??"" -> ""ababc"".

Explanation
There are two test cases:
1) When N=2 we can just compare and see which bag is heavier and has the diamond.
2) When N=3 we can just take any two bags and the one which is heavier has the diamond if both weigh same then the third bag has the diamond.
So in both cases we put 1 bag on each side and weigh only once.

Using another example on S = ""abcd"", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = ""ab"", y = ""eee"", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = ""ec"", y = ""ffff"", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.
All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = ""abc"", indexes = [0, 1], sources = [""ab"",""bc""] is not a valid test case.

Scramble String,"Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.
Below is one possible representation of s1 = ""great"":
    great

  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.
For example, if we choose the node ""gr"" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string ""rgeat"".
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
We say that ""rgeat"" is a scrambled string of ""great"".
Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes ""eat"" and ""at"", it produces a scrambled string ""rgtae"".
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
